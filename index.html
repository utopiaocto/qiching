    <h4> "Everything is made up of atoms!"  - Richard Feynman -   </h4>
    <h5>Quantum physics is a discipline that deals with atoms, which exist in states of particles or waves. The I Ching, or Book of Changes, addresses the world of particles or waves, as atoms relate to the sky, people, and the earth. A sincere desire generates waves, and observing these waves creates particles that provide answers - this is the principle of the I Ching. Niels Bohr, the father of quantum physics, discovered the principle of complementarity in the I Ching, which earned him a Nobel Prize in Physics. This program is the world's first implementation of a quantum I Ching algorithm, applying the principles of quantum physics to the I Ching based on a decade of research in I Ching science. By observing and making decisions, you can design your future. Write your story with sincere desire below. You will find your answer. </h5>
